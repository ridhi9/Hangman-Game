# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.
Game selects a word from a predetermined list and then displays blank spaces for each letter of the word. The player then guesses letters until they either correctly 
guess the word or run out of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in the drawing of a "hangman" figure on the screen, with the game ending when the hangman is fully 
drawn or the word is correctly guessed.
